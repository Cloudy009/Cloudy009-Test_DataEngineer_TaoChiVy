#### Tool-Specific Notes

---

- **FAISS**
  - Developed by Facebook AI Research.
  - Extremely fast but designed for in-memory operation.
  - No built-in REST API; used via Python or C++ bindings.

- **Qdrant**
  - Written in Rust for high performance and safety.
  - Offers REST and gRPC interfaces.
  - Supports payload (metadata) filtering and hybrid queries.
  - Easy to self-host via Docker or binary.

- **Pinecone**
  - Fully-managed SaaS platform; no on-premise hosting.
  - Excellent scalability, auto-scaling infrastructure.
  - No open-source version, but simple to use via REST/SDKs.

- **Weaviate**
  - Built in Go; supports hybrid search combining lexical (BM25) + vector.
  - Has built-in vectorizers (e.g., transformers).
  - GraphQL and REST API support.

- **Milvus**
  - High-performance cloud-native DB developed by Zilliz.
  - Supports multiple ANN algorithms: IVF, HNSW, ANNOY.
  - Works with Zilliz Cloud or self-hosted.
  - Suited for enterprise-scale vector workloads.
